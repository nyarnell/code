What is going on? How does it work? I have no clue.
Promela seems to be the kind of language that is only well
explained through interactive examples. Simply looking at the
specifications for the language or even running pieces of
toy code aren't enough for me to grasp what's going on.
Is my code right? Is it doing what you asked? I don't know.
Part of the problem is that assignments are so trivial
(in a sense) that for you to provide us with examples of the
functionality of channels would basically do much of the
homework for us. /shrug
