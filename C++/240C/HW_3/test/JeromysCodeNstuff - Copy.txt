This is the file of things im trying to find that i didnt see finished so far, some things might already be finished
but i just didnt find it


Need the grow grass function.
Need to keep track of the income, houses mowed during simulation.
Need log file.
Need to keep track of operation costs.
Need an inner loop for minutes// if minutes==travel time-mowing time starts, if minutes==mowing time- move to next house
Mean dog exception:
if(rand function<=0.02)
	{
	//Move crew to another house, exception: dog in yard
	
	};
travel time
	current location is (x,y) coordinate,
	next location is (x2,y1)
	distance=(x2-x)+(y2-y) //is the total miles driven to next destination
	travel_time=distance/0.5;
	Truck_cost=0.55*distance;

mowing time
	yard_size=length*width;
	mowing rate is 600/(grass height-2);
	total moving time is yard_size/mowing_rate;
	mower_costs=yard_size/0.005;	

Pay for crew per day-
	if not rained $17*how_many_crews*10hrs;
