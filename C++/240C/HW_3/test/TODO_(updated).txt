OK. I fixed it by changing best_lawn to be just a Lawn, not a pointer to a Lawn, doing away the temp and the dynamic memory allocation, and passing a dereferenced iterator into set_best_lawn, instead of the address of an iterator. (I also had to take away a pointer on the declaration of that pointer.) I don't see any advantage to having this member variable dynamically allocated.

^ dolan on the seg fault. Someone smart puzzle out exactly what he means about set_best_lawn
