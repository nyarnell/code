program starts:
	initialize company object.
	get the CLA (command line argument) of customers from lawns.txt.
		for each customer: set house_number, street_name, location[1], coordinates[1], income, grass_length=3.0, calculate lawn_area
		do this in an input function, so it can be reused when new customers are randomly added later. Leave lawn.txt open.
	generate the CLA of crew objects (inside company object?) (are crew objects necessary?)
	get CLA for number of days. Start outer loop with (int i=1, while i<CLA) start with day 1 not 0;
		at the beginning of the loop, check for adding a new customer. if yes -> call customer.input();
		prioritize queue based on grass_length;
		check for rain. if yes ->
			need to pay each crew $20
			grass of every house in priority queue needs to grow by .27 inches.
			output to logfile that it has rained on this day number (i).
		else if priorityqueue.top()<3.0
			pay each crew $20
			grass of all houses needs to grow .15 inches
		else we have lawns to cut and the weather is good.
			At the beginning of the day, the location of all crews need to be set to (5.0), (7.5)
			begin hour loop for 10 hours.
				each hour, we should pay each crew $17
				each minute, we need to:
					check if if crew on top of our crew list is busy. If they are, move to the next crew until one is found.
					if none are found, increment minute
					else we need to check if the crew can travel to the house and mow it before the end of the day.
					if they can and the house's grass_length > 2.0:
						calculate how many minutes it will take the crew to travel there and cut the grass.
						calculate how much money that will cost.
						use the minute counter to set the crew to busy until they are done
						when they are set to arrive at the house, do the dog exception check.
						if the dog is not there, change the crew's location to the house's location
						when they are done, set the house's grass length to 2.0 and insert the house at the bottom of the priorityqueue.
						set busy to false
					
			grass grows by .15 inches.
